You can scedule the report to be run at a specific time, go on edit -> edit schedule -> choose the time. 
! it will erase the previous result and the time range picker won't be available anymore ! 
The benefit is that when the report will be run automaticly, it will reduce the amount of individual search, because if everyone needs to run the report each time, same commands will be repetead X times, creating a lot of querry
